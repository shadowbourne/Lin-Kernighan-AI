# Lin-Kernighan-and-2O
A project for solving the travelling salesman problem with Lin Kernighan and 2-opt algorithms, comparing their efficiency and devising methods to enhance both algorithms further.
Enhancements made and their relative successes are described fully in the AISearchProforma.pdf.
The python scripts contain the algorithm's codes inside some prewritten skeleton code for reading, and saving tours to file, along with checking their validity.
